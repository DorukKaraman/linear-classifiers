# Linear Classification Algorithms

This repository contains implementations and comparisons of linear classification algorithms, including:

- Perceptron Algorithm (from scratch implementation)
- Visualization of decision boundaries
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook linear_classification_algorithms.ipynb
   ```

## Notes
- The dataset is synthetic and generated using scikit-learn.
- The perceptron algorithm is implemented from scratch for educational purposes.
